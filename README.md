dAuto uses...
 - NEAR Blockchain, enabling immutable records and increasing transperancy
 - Machine Learning, to accuratley assess fradulant claims in real-time
 - Peer to Peer service, connecting people with a community driven insurance experience

dAuto harnesses the power of NEAR, a crypto currency, to complete end to end transactions. We overcome
the problem of lengthy insurance claims, with zero transperancy of where your claim is. By utilizing
crypto and a machine learning algorithm trained off of 30,000 unique insurance claims, dAuto gets you your
money when you really need it.

#### Notes

This project was created by [Victor Chan](https://github.com/VictorChan880), [Alena Wang](https://github.com/aalenaw), [Annabelle Woo](https://github.com/AnnabellebwWoo) and [JacobJung](https://github.com/JacobJungg) from Friday May 17th - Sunday May 19th to compete in HawkHacks 2024. Check it out on [Taikai!]([https://github.com/aalenaw](https://taikai.network/hackbox/hackathons/hawkhacks/projects/clwdlk5ib0gu1yg01wcuxj3n9/idea))

dAuto utilzied [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/niteshyadav3103/insurance-fraud-detection-using-12-models) to
find reputable insurance claims for the machine learning algorithm

dAuto is built over a [NEAR template](https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book-examples)
